        <h2>What changes when we teach a model a character?</h2>
        <p>A constitution describes a trait in words. Character training tries to build that trait into the model itself. EigenBench measures how much of it shows up in the model’s answers, and what else changes along with it.</p>

        <p>What happens if you prompt a character-trained model with a different constitution?
